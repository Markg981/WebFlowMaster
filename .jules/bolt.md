## 2024-05-24 - N+1 Query in Test Plan Execution
**Learning:** The `runTestPlan` function in `server/test-execution-service.ts` was executing a separate DB query for each UI/API test inside the sequential execution loop, causing an N+1 query bottleneck.
**Action:** Always batch fetch related models using `inArray` and store them in O(1) memory lookup maps (e.g., `new Map()`) prior to looping when querying associations inside loops using Drizzle ORM.
## 2026-07-04 - Combined iteration for Test metrics in Server Routes
**Learning:** Multiple passes over array iterating data caused performance issues.
**Action:** Used single loop.
